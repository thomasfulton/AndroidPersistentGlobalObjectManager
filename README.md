# AndroidPersistentGlobalObjectManager
This class allows you to store a persistent global object correctly. Many guides incorrectly suggest using a regular singleton class or subclassing the `Application` object. This is incorrect, as these will become `null` if the OS kills and recreates your application. This class automatically serializes your object to `SharedPreferences` to prevent this from happening. To use, copy the class into your project. Subclass the manager for whichever object you want to store, create a singleton instance of your subclass manager, and call `get()` and `set()` on your singleton instance. This class will handle the rest.
